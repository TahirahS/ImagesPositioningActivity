    <p>Web Entrepreneurs<br>Let Your Web Site Do Your Work</p>
    <br>
    <p>You want to run a business out of your home or a storefront, but you need a sales and marketing plan. The Web can be your most effective, tireless 24x7 salesperson. Here are some tips to turn your Web site into an effective marketing tool:</p>
    <div id="looks">
      <h2>Looks Matter</h2>
      <br>
      <p>If your site looks amateurish, you'll lose credibility with your customers. Avoid using blinking, flashing, scrolling, and crawling text. You're running a business Web site, not a carnival. Choose a readable font in a size that's easy to read. Stick to one font face and not more than three font sizes. It may be interesting to have 10 different font faces on your site, but having too many font faces tends to detract from your site, not enhance it. Your Web site should not look like a ransom note. Use neutral tones or colors that complement each other. Avoid red and green color combinations â€” 5% of the population is color blind and may have trouble reading such text. Red is also associated with danger and financial loss.

    <div id="tales">
      <h2>Title Tales</h2>
      <p>No, I'm not talking about titles such as Ms. or Mrs. and the like. Search engines scan the title bar in their search for "hits." If your company name is "Astro Galaxy Unlimited" and you sell cosmetics, you might do a great job in attracting astrophysicists to your Web site, but you're not going to land at the top of anyone's hit list who's searching for cosmetics. Include meaningful words in the title, not just the company name.</p>
    </div>
     <div id = "entertain">
      <h2>Let Your Page Inform, not Entertain</h2>
      <p>Flash is a technology that places interesting animations on a Web page. Don't let your site have a Flash "splash page," whereby the visitor to your site has to click to first get past the Flash page in order to view your home page. Put the Flash presentations on your home page so that the user has a choice of whether or not to view the Flash presentation.</p>

      <p>"Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition"<br>Steve Jobs</p>
